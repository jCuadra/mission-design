# mission-design
MATLAB tool that designs a mission based on given constraints, similar to the traveling salesman problem.

Run missionGUI and set the parameters, including the start and end planet, and any other planets that should be visited.  Adjust start date, time step, and duration.  Other options may not be implemented yet.  Click RUN to begin computations.  Progress will be shown in the Command Window.  When the computations are complete, press the Return key to view the mission animation.

Developed and tested on MATLAB R2016b.
